# Scrypted Home Assistant Plugin

The Home Assistant Plugin for Scrypted imports `notify` services to be used within Scrypted. This plugin is currently only functional if Scrypted was installed as a Home Assistant Addon.

This plugin is primarily intended for usage with Scrypted NVR's notification delivery.
